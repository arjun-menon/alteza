Here's a joyful squirrel.

Want to learn about a [magic turtle]({{link("magic-turtle")}})?

What about a [[curious-cat]]? <small>(Or a [[baby-squirrel]] or a [[baby-chipmunk]]?)</small>

This is [what a "megabyte" is]({{link("just_a_test")}}).

A few dats:
  This page was created (or renamed) on {{getCreateDate("%B %-d, %Y")}}.
  * We got this from git history.
      * But we got the idea for this on {{getIdeaDate("%B %-d, %Y")}}.
          * And it's great we can track both dates.
  * This page was last modified on {{getLastModified()}}.
    - We got this from git history as well.
        - But spawning a git process could be slow.

Back to the [parent](..) level.
