Alteza
======

Alteza is a static site generator driven by [PyPage](https://github.com/arjun-menon/pypage).
Examples of other static site generators can be [found here](https://github.com/collections/static-site-generators).

The differentiator with Alteza is that the site author (if familiar with Python) will have a lot more 
fine-grained control over the output, than what (as far as I'm aware) any of the existing options offer.

The learning curve is also shorter with Alteza. I've tried to follow part of [xmonad](https://xmonad.org/)'s philosophy
of keeping things small and simple. Alteza doesn't try to do a lot of things; instead it simply offers the core crucial
functionality that is common to most static site generators.

Alteza also imposes very little _required_ structure or a particular "way of doing things" on your website. You retain
the freedom of organize your website as you wish. (The name _Alteza_ comes from a word that may be
translated to [illustrious](https://m.interglot.com/en/es/illustriousness) in Espa√±ol.)

A core design decision of Alteza is executing code (and writing little scripts) to generate your website. (This of
course means that you must run Alteza with trusted code, or in an isolated container.)

## The Basics

1. Recursively go through all directories.
2. At each directory (descending downward), execute an `__config__.py` file, if one is present. After
   execution, absorb the variables into an `env` dict.
3. Process all `.md` and `.html` files with `pypage`. Pass the `env` dict to Pypage.
   1. Pypage is called on the "leaf nodes" (innermost files) first, and then upwards.
   2. Thus, the `.md` and `.html` files in the parent directory receives a list of objects representing the processed results of all its subdirectories. (And, this is repeated, recursively upwards).
4. Resultant HTML output is copied to the output directory (and non-HTML output symlinked there).


## Testing

To run, execute the `core` module itself, from the project directory:
```sh
python3 -m core
```

### Type checking & reformatting
To run some type checks:
```sh
mypy core  # should have zero errors
pyre check  # should have zero errors as well
pyright core  # should have zero errors also
pytype core  # should have zero errors too
```
Or all at once with: `mypy core ; pyre check ; pyright core ; pytype core`.

To re-format the code, just run: `black core`.

### Dependencies

To install dependencies, run:
```sh
brew install watchman # on macOS
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To use a virtual environment (after creating one with `python3 -m venv venv`):
```sh
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# ... do some testing ...
deactive # end the venv
```
