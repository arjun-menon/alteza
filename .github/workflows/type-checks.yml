  # This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
  # They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
  # separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
  # documentation.

  # This workflow integrates Pyre with GitHub's
  # Code Scanning feature.
  #
  # Pyre is a performant type checker for Python compliant with
  # PEP 484. Pyre can analyze codebases with millions of lines
  # of code incrementally â€“ providing instantaneous feedback
  # to developers as they write code.
